## `%association_rule_mining()` macro <a name="associationrulemining-macro-1"></a> ######

Macro Name : association_rule_mining
  Purpose    : Performs Market Basket (Association Rule) Analysis 
                   to efficiently compute 1-item and 2-item
                   co-occurrence frequencies and derive key association metrics.

  Overview   :
    - The macro takes a transactional dataset (ID, ITEM) as input.
    - It counts single-item occurrences and two-item co-occurrences
       across unique transactions.
    - It outputs 1-item statistics and 2-item directional association rules
      (e.g., ITEM → ITEM2) with standard association metrics:
        * Support
        * Confidence
        * Lift

  Parameters :
    inds=             Input dataset name (e.g., AE)
    person=           Transaction or subject identifier (e.g., USUBJID)
    item=             Item variable representing product/event (e.g., AEDECOD)
    itemset_length=   Length for character variable VECTOR (default: $500)
                      VECTOR is used to display the rule "ITEM --> ITEM2".

  Input  :
    - Dataset &inds. containing at least the variables &person. and &item.
    - The macro internally creates &inds._nodup as a unique (ID, ITEM) dataset
      to avoid double-counting within the same transaction.

  Output :
    - Dataset: association_rule_mining
      Variables:
        VECTOR        : Display text for the rule (e.g., "Headache --> Nausea")
        ITEM, ITEM2   : Left-hand and right-hand items
        COUNT         : Frequency of the item or item-pair
        SUPPORT       : Support value (frequency ratio)
        CONFIDENCE    : Confidence value (conditional probability)
        LIFT          : Lift value (measure of association strength)

 Useage  Example :
    %association_rule_mining(
      inds=AE,
      person=USUBJID,
      item=AEDECOD,
      itemset_length=$500
    );

  Association Metrics and Derivations
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Let:
      N           = Total number of unique transactions (distinct IDs)
      count(X)    = Number of transactions containing item X
      count(X,Y)  = Number of transactions containing both X and Y
      P(A)        = Probability of event A = count(A) / N

    1) Support (SUPPORT)
       - The proportion of transactions containing the item(s):
           SUPPORT(X,Y) = count(X,Y) / N
           SUPPORT(X)   = count(X) / N

    2) Confidence (CONFIDENCE)
       - The conditional probability of Y given X:
           CONFIDENCE(X→Y) = P(Y | X)
                            = count(X,Y) / count(X)

    3) Lift (LIFT)
       - The ratio of observed co-occurrence to independence expectation:
           LIFT(X→Y) = CONFIDENCE(X→Y) / P(Y)
                     = [count(X,Y) / count(X)] / [count(Y) / N]
                     = (count(X,Y) * N) / [count(X) * count(Y)]

       Interpretation:
         LIFT > 1 : Positive association (X increases likelihood of Y)
         LIFT = 1 : Independent relationship
         LIFT < 1 : Negative association (X suppresses Y)

    * 1-item rules output SUPPORT only (CONFIDENCE and LIFT are missing).
